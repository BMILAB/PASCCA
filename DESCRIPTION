Description: PASCCA is an easy-to-use R package for analyses of APA 
		related gene expression, including the characterization of poly(A)
		sites, quantification of association between genes with/without 
		repeated measurements, clustering of APA-related genes to infer
		significant APA specific gene modules, and the evaluation of 
		clustering performance with a variety of indexes.
